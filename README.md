## The Model

 I used the kinematic motion model as in th elessons to model the motion of the car.

 State variables 
     x position of car (x)
     y position of car (y)
     yaw angle (psi)
     speed in heading direction (v)
     cross track error (cte)
     yaw angle error (epsi)

 Actuations
     acceleration in heading direction (a)
     steering angle (delta)

 Kinematic model
      x_[t+1] = x[t] + v[t] * cos(psi[t]) * dt
      y_[t+1] = y[t] + v[t] * sin(psi[t]) * dt
      psi_[t+1] = psi[t] + v[t] / Lf * delta[t] * dt
      v_[t+1] = v[t] + a[t] * dt

 The reference trajectory was modelled using a 3rd order polynomial fitted to the waypoints given by the simulator. 

 cte and epsi were calculated aftre converting the state variables to car-cordinate system for calculation simplicity.

 Then cte is simply the y co-ordinate of the reference trajectory (fitted polynomial) at x = 0.
      cte = polyeval(coeffs,0)

 and epsi is the direction of the reference trajectory at x = 0. i.e. arctangent of the derivative of the reference trajectory
      epsi = -atan(coeffs[1] + 2 * coeffs[2] * px + 3 * coeffs[3] * px * px)


## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

 Ideally N(Elapsed duration) should be as large as possible to account for the 
 behaviour of the reference trajectory and dt(Timestep length) should be as small as possibble so that modelling is closer to the actual behaviour.

 Increasing N and decreasing dt has computational cost,which is a consideration in
 a real time system.

 There is no benefit in increasing N above a certain point since the motion model
 and the reference trajectory is not 100% accurate and is less accurate the
 further we look i n to the future.

 Since there is a latency of 0.1 ms in the system there is no need for
 dt to be better than that. (i.e. to account for latency the we calculate
 state after the latency period, by assuming the constant control inputs
 for latency period)

 Calculation horizon N was reduced to 10 and delta t was increased to 0.1 from
 values used in the quizz to speed up the calculations.

* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)
5. **VM Latency:** Some students have reported differences in behavior using VM's ostensibly a result of latency.  Please let us know if issues arise as a result of a VM environment.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
